Analyzing two text inputs below. The first input is a static resume (Resume), the second input is a job description (JD).

Your first job is to create a list of items (up to 10) that are found in the JD which overlap with work experience in the Resume. Format this list as a numbered list. Each item in the list contains only the words, verbatim, as they appear in the JD. In a sub-bullet (indented) to each item, add a bulleted list of the text from the Resume which caused you to include the item. Only focus on skills and experience which are being required, or cultural / behavioral details, in the JD. Examples of skills include technical ones, such as the programming language (Python, JavaScript), framework (Django), or tools (AWS, PostgreSQL). Skills can also be "soft", such as leadership and mentoring. Examples of cultural or behavioral details include company culture descriptions (startup environment, wear many hats, fast-paced environment) or descriptions about values (craftsmanship, entrepreneurship, focus on quality / value / product)...

When analyzing the JD, focus on the details in sections related to the job tasks / responsibilities, and the candidate ("you") qualifications / experience. Prioritize the order of items in the list based on the order in which they appear. "Required" or "must have" items should be first, followed by "preferred" items. "Nice to have" items can be listed last. 

Your second job is to take the first output and generate 5 summary sentences, formatted as bullets, to summarize these overlapping items. The 5 summary sentences should be concise, not wordy. The sentences should prefer to reuse the language, especially verbs and names of technologies, as they appear in the JD. The sentences should speak to an audience consisting of the hiring manager and recruiter, i.e. the authors of the JD, and appeal to what they are looking for in job candidates. Use a long dashed line to separate outputs 1 and 2.
